Special Recognition: Ahmad Mousa is as passionate and caring as he is knowledgeable, and Joshua Steier never hesitates to help walk us through challenges. I always do participate in office hours and study groups while working on projects with collaborators including but not necessarily limited to the following peers: Ilknur Sekmen, Justin Ibeh, Karson Kosek, Kiara Shannon, Luisa Dinwiddie, Margo Berry, Morgan Escue, Morgan Foge, Nathan Johnson, William Brewer, Andrew Clifft, Angela Reed, and Josh Gibson; however, the AskBCS Learning Assistants remain my primary resource when I do get stuck. Forest Prodan and Maria Wolfgang both offered specific guidance when I got stuck on portions of the data analysis steps.
